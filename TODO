* Implement highlevel paradigms (Rpc, Direct, etc.)

* Allow setting tcp heartbeat
* Error handing / monitors
* Document interfaces

* Unit / integration testing

* Enable / Allow publisher confirms (Confirm.Select) per channel
  (A publisher would wait for the next ack. We need to keep a window of send, but not yet ack'ed messages)

* Handle immediate flag in publish
  (Return messages - requires an async handler)

* Handle flow on channels

* Handle channel close (callback with error code)
