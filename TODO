* Allow setting tcp heartbeat
* Make sure we choose the ip address at random (if the host resolves to multiple servers)
* Error handing / monitors

* Handle immediate flag in publish
  (Return messages - requires an async handler)

* Handle flow on channels

* Support immutable strings

* Consumer cancels: when a consumer is cancelled (on a channel) we should close the pipe.

* Use iovecs for reading and writing. Use Core endian
