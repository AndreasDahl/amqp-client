Remove dependency on Batteries
Implement highlevel paradigms (Rpc, Direct, etc.)
Build a async protocol writer.
Get the length a spec + arg
Recursive definition of spec's:

Octet :: Sub (Octet :: Octet :: Nil) :: nil
Octet :: LongSub (Octet :: Octet :: Nil) :: nil
(Longsub will first write a long with the length of the sub.)

Use ocplib-endian for endian conversion. Build own writer / reader
Reader and writer must work on a string. Its ok that the framing layer must read bits a peices.
